# AngularUI Calendar with Drag and Drop

##Install
`bower install`

------------------------------------------
I did not find many examples where [AngularUI Calendar](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-calendar/) is used with [drag and drop](https://github.com/codef0rmer/angular-dragdrop) feature. 
So, while working I came up with this.
With comments I also indicated where we can make a request to save the data and populate retrieved data on calendar.
Hope to update more when able.
